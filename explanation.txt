-- Description of the game --

"Are you the one", in France "10 couples parfaits",
is a reality television series in wich 10 boys and 10 girls
are trying to find how they are paired (called "Perfect Matches").

During 10 weeks, they have 2 kind of events :
1/ "Truth Booths" (in France, "Love Machine") where
one boy and one girl can know if they are Perfect Match or not, and
2/ "Ceremonies", where one combination of the 10 couples is tested,
we know how many are Perfect Matches, but we don't know which ones.

-- Computer Science interest --

This game is similar to Mastermind, with one big restriction :
the boys and girls decide themselves how to arrange the couples,
the observer (meaning us) can only deduce the probabilities
afterwards.

The current project is to compute probabilities of Perfect Matches,
based on the Truth Booths and the Ceremonies. As the number of
combinations is few (less than one billion), we compute all possible
combinations, and then count how many occurs for each possible couples.

This project can be usefull to empirically validate a pure Mathematical
approach, or to control a Bayesian algorithm.

This project may also be usefull to see how to deal with permutations
and arrangements in c language, and how to use a generator mechanism
(the "yield" keyword in Python) in a pure c language program.

-- Results --

We focused on season 2 and Season 3 of the French version,
where there is one more candidate : 11 girls with 10 boys for season 2,
10 girls with 11 boys for season 3.

This corresponds to an Arrangement of 10 elements into 11 positions,
with one element in double.

This results around 200 millions of combinations;
1/ a Permutation of 11 elements => 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10*11 combinations
2/ the 11th element is replaced with each 10 possible elements => * 10
3/ every arrangement is counted twice => / 2
So after each event (Truth Booths or Ceremonies), we have
1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10*11 * 10 / 2 = 199584000 combinations to review.

The program is written in c language, it takes around 20 seconds for each events
(in a single Personal Computer), and takes less than 10 minutes for all steps.

-- Use --

The project is a single program file called proba_eleven.c,
you can compile it using any c compiler, for example gcc.
